# Google CodeJam Solutions

## Overview

This contains my solutions to various Google CodeJam problems.

Some were solved as part of the live competition. Others were solved for fun or practice outside of the competition setting.

## Folder structure

The folder structure is primarily sub-divided by the context in which the problems were solved:

| Context         | Description |
| ---             | ---         |
| Practice        | Attempts on past problems. May be timed, but more likely done at leisure. |
| Live            | Code written live during the competition (whether submitted or not).       |
| PostCompetition | Rewrites of competition code for learning purposes... bug fixes, alternate algorithms, different programming languages. |
