The PostCompetition folder contains fixes I made to problems I attempted unsuccessfully during the competition.
This was an exercise to learn from my mistakes, improve syntax (e.g. when using gcj to learn a new language), or try other solution methods.

NB: Problems from competitions I didn't participate in, or which I didn't attempt during the competition, will be found in the Practice folder.
